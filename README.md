Code to reproduce results in Ziyi Yin, Mathias Louboutin, Olav MÃ¸yner, Felix J. Herrmann, "[Time-lapse full-waveform permeability inversion: a feasibility study](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04083)". DOI: 10.48550/arXiv.2403.04083

## Software descriptions

All of the software packages used in this paper are fully *open source, scalable, interoperable, and differentiable*. The readers are welcome to learn about our software design principles from [this open-access article](https://library.seg.org/doi/10.1190/tle42070474.1).

#### Wave modeling

We use [JUDI.jl](https://github.com/slimgroup/JUDI.jl) for wave modeling and inversion, which calls the highly optimized propagators of [Devito](https://www.devitoproject.org/).

#### Multiphase flow

We use [JutulDarcyRules.jl] to solve the multiphase flow equations, which calls the high-performant and auto-differentiable numerical solvers in [Jutul.jl] and [JutulDarcy.jl]. [JutulDarcyRules.jl] is designed to interoperate these two packages with other Julia packages in the Julia AD ecosystem via [ChainRules.jl].

## Installation

First, install [Julia](https://julialang.org/) and [Python](https://www.python.org/). The scripts will contain package installation commands at the beginning so the packages used in the experiments will be automatically installed.

## Scripts

[case-1.jl](scripts/case-1.jl) runs end-to-end permeability inversion with a homogeneous initial permeability model.

[case-2.jl](scripts/case-2.jl) runs end-to-end permeability inversion with a distorted initial permeability model.

[baseline-FWI.jl](scripts/baseline-FWI.jl) runs full-waveform inversion to estimate the baseline brine-filled velocity model.

[case-3.jl](scripts/case-3.jl) uses the inverted baseline brine-filled velocity model obtained above to run end-to-end permeability inversion.
